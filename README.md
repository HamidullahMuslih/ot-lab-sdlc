# OT Lab3 (DevSecOps)

Web applications are indispensable in the modern digital landscape. As a Security Specialist, a
significant aspect of your role involves identifying security concerns within web applications prior
to deployment and addressing vulnerabilities post-deployment before they are exploited by
others.
Additionally, with the widespread adoption of microservice architecture and DevOps practices
across companies, it's crucial to understand how to seamlessly integrate security tools into the
CI/CD pipeline. This lab will equip you with the skills to incorporate security measures
throughout the software development lifecycle, enabling you to continuously build, test, and
deploy secure software. Essentially, it focuses on implementing a DevSecOps CI/CD pipeline in
straightforward terms.
